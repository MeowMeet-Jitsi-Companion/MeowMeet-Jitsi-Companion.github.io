## General Bugs
### App
- The Jitsi Meet app does not work

This bug will not be fixed as we are using web app and it is the system's nature.
### HTTP 503
- Sometimes, there will be an error saying "Database is locked" as the server owner is viewing the database file.
- There will be an Internal Server Error 503 when the email exists while transfering accounts. THE TRANSFER IS UNSUCESSFUL because the email account already exists in that server.

These bugs will be fixed in future versions.
